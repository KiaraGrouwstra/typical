# Typical

### tl;dr?

Lodash for types.

### Installing

```
npm i typical-ts
```

### [Docs](http://tycho01.github.io/typical/index.html)

### Background?

I'd been trying to type a library (Ramda -- [repo](http://ramdajs.com/docs/), [typings](https://github.com/types/npm-ramda/)),
and found that there would be a lot more return types we *could* be figuring out the types for.
No-one had just quite figured out how to compose the basic type operators to construct larger building blocks yet.
That is where this library comes in.

### Contributing

Run the tests (`npm test`) or check [`errors.log`](https://github.com/tycho01/typical/blob/master/errors.log).
